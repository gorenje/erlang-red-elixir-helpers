# Erlang-Red Elixir Helpers

This is the place for adding Elixir code to the project.

Initially this Elixir project only contains [earmark](https://erlangforums.com/t/markdown-support-how-best-to-do-that/4744/2?u=gorenje) for the markdown node.

It is, as much in life, just a proof of concept and was the first best thing that happened into my mind.

It works well enough and was inspired by this [approach](https://joearms.github.io/published/2017-12-18-Calling-Elixir-From-Erlang.html).
